# H. Spark and Machine Learning
 
> 1. Spark has two machine learning libraries with different APIs, but including implementations of similar algorithms. These machine learning algorithms and utilities have been designed to scale across a cluster by way of inclusion of parallel algorithms in which operations can be applied in parallel across nodes.
>> - **spark.mllib**: spark.mllib is the older built-in Spark machine learning library. It consists of learning algorithms using Sparkâ€™s RDD operations. To leverage this, you need to create data (as RDDs) and operate on data in a distributed, parallelizable manner to make them available to all nodes in the cluster.
>> - **spark.ml**: The newer library which is inspired by scikit-learn. It provides a uniform set of high-level API built on top of DataFrames for constructing and tuning machine learning pipelines. 
> 2. As of Spark 2.0, the RDD-based APIs (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/rdd-programming-guide.html#resilient-distributed-datasets-rdds) in the spark.mllib package have entered maintenance mode. The primary Machine Learning API for Spark is now the DataFrame-based API (https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/sql-programming-guide.html) in the spark.ml package. Therefore, Apache Spark recommends using spark.ml instead of spark.mllib. Read more at URL https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/ml-guide.html#announcement-dataframe-based-api-is-primary-api
