# G. PySpark
 
> 1. Spark is an in-memory distributed computing engine especially designed for the Hadoop cluster. 
> 2. Read more on Apache Spark at URL https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Spark

## G1. Installation and Configuration
1.	Download the correct version of Spark from the Apache Spark downloads page (http://spark.apache.org/downloads.html), and check the compatible with your installed Hadoop
~~~
$ wget https://downloads.apache.org/spark/spark-3.5.0/spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3-scala2.13.tgz
~~~

2.	Uncompress the file
~~~
$ tar -xvzf spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3-scala2.13.tgz
~~~

3.	Rename the Spark folder as spark
~~~
$ mv spark-3.5.0-bin-hadoop3-scala2.13 spark
~~~

4.	Edit the file ~/.bashrc with the the following lines
~~~
export SPARK_HOME=/home/hduser/spark
export PATH=$SPARK_HOME/bin:$PATH
~~~

5.	Re-load the environment
~~~
source ~/.bashrc
~~~

5.	Launch the PySpark interactive shell/interpreter
~~~
pyspark
~~~
> To exit the pyspark shell with command exit()

6. To minimize the verbosity of Spark , you need to configure the settings of log4j after duplicating the template file (optional).
~~~
$ cp $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j2.properties.template $SPARK_HOME/conf/log4j2.properties
~~~
> Edit the newly created log4j file, by replacing every occurrence of INFO with WARN, e.g.
> rootLogger.level = warn  
> rootLogger.appenderRef.stdout.ref = console  


## G2. Using the PySpark Interactive Shell - Word Count 
1.	Launch PySparkâ€™s interactive shell using user hduser
2.	Create an Resilient Distributed Dataset (RDD) with data from a text file. It transforms the RDD to implement the word count application using Spark.
~~~
>>> text = sc.textFile("shakespeare.txt")
>>> print(text)
>>> from operator import add
>>> def tokenize(text): return text.split()
...
>>> words = text.flatMap(tokenize)
~~~

3.	It applies the map, and then it applies the reduceByKey action to obtain the word counts before saving the results in file
~~~
>>> wc = words.map(lambda x: (x, 1))
>>> print(wc.toDebugString())
>>> counts = wc.reduceByKey(add)
>>> counts.saveAsTextFile("hdfs://localhost:9000/user/hduser/wc")
~~~
> Apache spark version 3.3.6 does not need to have the hdfs directory path (hdfs://localhost:9000/user/hduser/) explicitly indicated to write in the local path, i.e., /home/hduser. Example:
> counts.saveAsTextFile("wc")
