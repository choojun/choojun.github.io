# Hello World!

I have more than 10-year experience in software design and development, as well as research and development in computational intelligence. I have gained extensive experience and skills in various job positions while serving small-medium industries (SMIs) and semi-conductor manufacturers, and universities. These organisations include Multimedia Super Corridor (MSC)-based companies and universities in Malaysia as well as Singapore-based software development companies. In addition to my industrial experience, I'm also an academic staff at a local university in Malaysia. I have substantial experience in conducting classes and serving as learning advisor for undergraduate and post-graduate students.

My research interest is in the design and development of computational intelligence models, especially evolutionary algorithms, and their applications to multi-objective optimisation problems.
