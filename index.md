# Hello World!

I have more than 10-year experience in software design and development, as well as research and development in computational intelligence. I have gained extensive experience and technical skills in various organizations, including Multimedia Super Corridor status companies in Malaysia and software development companies in Singapore. I have successfully developed a broad range of applications for serving small-medium industries, multi-national corporations and government agencies in the sectors of banking-finance, retail-commerce, logistic-sales, realty-development, production-manufacturing, and criminal-defence. Whist holding a certified database administrator, these applications were deployed in Europe and Asia-Pacific across the Windows, Linux and Unit platforms.

In addition to my industrial experience, I'm also an academic staff at a local university in Malaysia since year 2014. I have acquired extensive research and development experience in public and private universities, including [Universiti Sains Malaysia](https://www.usm.my/), [Universiti Malaya](https://www.um.edu.my/), and [Wawasan Open University](http://www.wou.edu.my/tan-choo-jun). I have substantial experience in conducting classes and serving as learning advisor for undergraduate and post-graduate students.

To date, my research interest is in the design and development of computational intelligence models, especially evolutionary algorithms, and their applications to multi-objective optimisation problems. I have published articles in high impact-factor journals and successfully secured collaborative grants between industry partners and universities through research projects.
