# Hello World!

I have more than 15 years of experience in software design and development in industry, research and development (R&D) as well as teaching in academic. I gained extensive experience and technical skills in various organizations, including Multimedia Super Corridor status companies in Malaysia and software development companies in Singapore. I successfully developed a board range of applications for serving small-medium industries, multi-national corporations and government agencies in the sectors of banking-finance, retail-commerce, logistic-sales, realty-development, production-manufacturing, and criminal-defense, which were deployed in Europe and Asia-Pacific.

I received my PhD degrees in 2014, with research in the area of computational intelligence. I have acquired extensive R&D experience in public and private universities at Malaysia. Beside as an invited scientist on the clean water and sustainable energy project, I have published articles and secured collaboration grants between industry partners and universities.

To date, my research interest is in the design and development of computational intelligence models, especially evolutionary algorithms, and their applications to multi-objective optimisation problems. I have published several indexed articles in the [Web of Science (WOS) core collection](https://publons.com/researcher/2461459/choo-jun-tan/publications/) and successfully secured collaborative grants between industry partners and universities through research projects.
